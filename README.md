# My Weather App

> Theme: A weather application that is very convenient for first time users.

In this application you can access any city in the world 
and check the forecast live. It will also display and broadcast the forecast for the next 5 days from the present day.

This application will also provide you with small weather images, the wind speed, and humidity.
